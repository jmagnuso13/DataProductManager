Each was wonderful and had everything we needed including the loan of beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. We didn’t cook, but each unit was well appointed with everything we would need and next time we will enjoy creating our own meals at the units and eat out less. We enjoyed visiting briefly with each owner, they were all really nice but not intrusive at all. We went on two excursions recommended and booked through Airbnb. They were great and good value. I would recommend the Wild Dolphin & Snorkeling adventure with Captain Chase and the Local Brews & Poke Flights with Lottie and a wonderful chef and fun bartender at a beautiful golf course. They were both awesome and each was a small group of 5-6 people allowing us to ask our hosts questions and visit with the other guests. We will likely use Airbnb more often, it was super easy to book the units, more fun and less expensive than a hotel. When they say ‘Super Host’ believe it, book it and relax. I’m a fan and sharing our experiences with friends. Mahalo!',\n",

I booked a one night $400 rental in Big Bear through this app on August 4th of this year and after arriving at the place my wife, kids and I realized that the pictures on the app did not match up to what I actually paid for (it was false advertising). We immediately walked out of the place and I called Airbnb Support to tell them what had occurred. They told me that they would resolve the issue and get back to me regarding my concern. The next day they called and asked if I had taken any pictures of the rental and I informed them that Airbnb Support never told me to do any of that. They placed the burden on me to prove my case even though I never used the rental and called them within minutes with my concern. I could have gotten another rental that same day (I didn’t book the place till almost 6PM) for much less, but I based my decision on getting the rental in question because of the pictures that were displayed on the app (the place looked modern, clean and new; what we walked into was much older, lacked character and looked like some hotel room). I am still trying to get my money back, but let this be a lesson so that you don’t struggle as I have. Use a credit card and you will have dispute rights (I used my debit card).',\n",

I work in customer service, and I have never seen and will never try to emulate the kind of awful customer service I experienced with AirBnb. \\n\\nI won’t get into the details because I’ve told this story too many times, but in essence, my host lied and claimed that my friends and I broke her air conditioning system and thermostat so she could charge us for the already-broken system. She also promised to refund us if we left our trip early, and—although we did—she refused the refund and then tried to charge us for the the thermostat (and at twice the cost of the actual unit). I contacted AirBnb about this promptly, and not only did they take weeks to answer me back, but they never had the decency to call me back and get my side of things (they only emailed after I complained about not getting a call despite my host getting a call from them). They took months to get to a resolution and their resolution, though vague and unclear, was along the lines of “your host doesn’t have to refund you, and you can solve this on your own.” \\n\\nSo, basically,  my host and I got into a predicament which AirBnb refused to solve. I believe that their only reason for not wanting to handle this in my favor is because this host rents out multiple locations through AirBnb, and so she is more of an asset to them than I am. I hope this review helps them to see how awful that logic is.',\n",

I didn’t want to pay the “arbitrary” service and cleaning fees just because I needed one night away which could add up to be over a hundred dollars.

This host was decent enough to tell me that he canceled due to the days I reserved for were already booked. Apparently Airbnb showed available rooms that were not really available. Called customer service and they didn’t give me any solutions, just sent me listings of places that were already not available or $5000 more in price.

I clicked the link in the email which opened the app but there was no indication of how or where to update the credit card. I finally found it, not in account settings, but (strangely) on the page of the failed booking. There was no option to remove a payment method nor to update a credit card. However there was a button to add a new payment method except the feature would not load. I just got the white page and the little animated dots. I tried restarting the app, restarting the phone, updating the app, and tried it on WiFi and cellular all over the course of about 12 hours. Nothing worked. So I logged into the website. There I found an option to delete a payment method but incredibly there was no option I could find to add a payment method. So I contacted customer service.

Problem is that most of these locations are 30 minutes away from where I actually want to be. As a traveler, this is mostly inconvenient. So then you have to waste your time checking through each posting to see which one is actually close to where you want to be. Please add a distance filter from the city center to fix this mess. Other room finding applications know how to manage distance, so airbnb is way behind.\\n\\nAside from that, either the posting is falsified by the host or the engine is misreading metadata, but some city locations at the top, don't match what is on the map. I feel like this must be the host lying about the location to try and get people to go to their location, but airbnb should just pull the city location from the map. If it does already, then it's broken.\\n\\nLastly, an enhancement request to the usability. Since I travel to the same place many times, I'm looking at the same locations a lot. Of course I have my favorites, but I'd like an opposite list of locations to avoid. Maybe I read a bad review or the neighborhood was not to my preference, then I don't want to have to figure that out each time I run a search.\",\n",

This causes me to lose so much money because I have to take it out of my profit and then file with the county and do my state taxes through an accountant because the system is too complex... Major inconvenience... and 2). This is my 2nd home. I do not want to rent it to just “anyone“. VRBO is better because they at least let you see the person‘s full name, and you can Google their information to make sure they are a real person, etc. There are so\\nMany scam emails. I have no problem with an AirBNB traveler who has previously had a review, but when a New, unknown person tries to books and gives me no information at all regarding their group or info on their trip, and all I have is a “first name”- it’s unnerving. I think they should try to protect the homeowners much better than what they do right now. It’s very one-sided towards the renter- where I would like much more of a mutual accountability.

       "  'review': 'I am traveling for just under a month and am using Air BnB for my travels. I am satisfied with most of my stats so far except one. This particular place was so dingy and run down that I immediately knew I did not want to stay there. Right away I contacted the host asking for the payment of my remaining two nights back so I could secure someplace else. She refused. So I contacted Air BnB and they too so long in figuring things out that I was well on to my next location by the time they said they had successfully negotiated a cleaning fee refund ($34). That was laughable. They told me I could dispute it further and asked me what was a fair compensation. I said that the fairest compensation was the two nights I had originally asked for. That would have been around $270. They negotiated some more and ended up refunding me $120. I am not impressed on the time it takes for them to respond and handle things, nor am I impressed with their negotiation skills. The place I stayed in was a dump and the pictures were a complete lie and they did nothing to fix that for future renters. I’ve now stayed in three other locations and I am very pleased with them. I like Air BnB but I don’t like their service.',\n",

I use the App on my iPad Pro with the most recent iOS an when I scroll through my search results, the movement is extremely slowly, sometimes gets even stuck. Something is wrong here. Search filters are also not perfect. When I set for example my limit at $200 per night, the App shows me also accommodations above $200. Also, it would be great if the location filter would be narrower. If I search for housing in a certain town I don‘t want to see housing from near-by towns. Unfortunately, one sometimes only find out once you check the map, because the title often does not tell the location. Maybe adding a distance option would help (how far from target destination the search should be expanded). \\n\\nAdditional comment: What I also dont like is that I cant remove my credit card information from my account after payment (not through the App and also not through the online account). I wished they would support Apple Pay. I don‘t like to keep my credit card information all over the internet.',\n",

I went to your q&a and found out you have a pretty strict set of rules for canceling on the host, but no real strict set of rules on hosts cancelling on guests. This is absolutely horrible. The host only loses the cancellation. The guests lose all that they had invested in the trip - airfare, other places to stay, any reservations and down payments on things like prearranged things or trips such as boating, kayaking, entry fees, etc.  Also I could not leave an Airbnb review on the host. This is absolutely uncalled for. Both the host and Airbnb need to know the consequences of this action. And others need to know that the host cancels on guests.  Airbnb really needs to rethink this policy. If a host cancel, they should be responsible for any costs that the guests incurred. I have heard that hosts will cancel if they get a higher rental fee. Don’t know if that happened to me, but that should absolutely be forbidden and if one cancellation occurs, the host should be moved to the lowest ranking. They must be discouraged from doing any cancellation.  They have to be running this like a business. The excuse I got was the host had to leave town and could not find someone to clean it before the last guest before me. Really poor excuse!!',\n",

However, after repeated attempts to receive said refund, they then claimed I had informed them too long after the reservation. They said this a week after my reservation but I had called DURING the first hour of check in for my reservation while I was AT the residence. I wish I had recorded their calls as they do yours, when dealing with customer support, and I would easily have enough evidence to show how they are misleading, careless about customer safety, and how they tell you one thing then flip to a completely different decision without the decency to call you to elaborate. They simply sent a short, rude message on the app. It is sad that they can agree with you (they can go ahead and listen to their recorded phone calls to prove it) and then message you something completely else and ignore the fact that they ever agreed with you.

Bottom line, the photo capture got thoroughly confused with iPad in landscape orientation (which if you have a keyboard attached, is how we generally use these things).

While she was nice she didn’t seem like she listened to a word I said. Now they continue to keep trying to take money for days I didn’t stay.  She claims she can’t reach the host but he’s a well respected doctor and we have mutual friends who are his neighbors so I’m inclined to believe his side of the story.  I would try home away vacation app instead (although I’ve never used, it but will be now). My family has properties listed on Airbnb and we will now be trying Home Away Vacation app instead as we don’t want or guests to have the same poor experience on their getaway.',\n",

There was a “beach view” but if you wanted to get near the actual beach you would have to cross a busy highway to get to it. Upon arriving we noticed this detail and called the property owners to cancel and get a refund. Leta, the supposed property owner became instantly hostile and aggressive over the phone, almost like she has dealt with this issue before and can’t even pretend to care. Airbnb was no better. They sided with the property owner and the $1,000 we spent on a 2-day rental was down the drain. We would have been more than happy to get the refund as a credit and spend it on another rental that wasn’t falsely advertised. But no such refund/credit was issued. Airbnb’s customer support is almost nonexistent so be super careful before booking that the rental is something you really want, because you won’t get in touch with another human for weeks after filing a complaint.

So I left the stay early due to feeling uncomfortable with the neighbors.

The host decided to put that in the review about the guest (me) along with multiple paragraphs of NOTHING BUT LIES. I contacted AirBnb about this, and after about a month and a half of waiting, they finally replied and said those paragraphs of lies and exaggerations “followed the guidelines”. Meanwhile I can pull up their “guidelines” and point out everything wrong with that review and how it doesn’t follow them. For example: “Content that refers to circumstances entirely out of another’s control”, “...assumptions about a persons character or personality”.

They also do not have a screwy algorithm like VRBO that can significantly reduce visibility and page views. My only suggestion at this point to AirBNB is to include local and state taxes in the calculations for guest stays. These are now frequently required nearly everywhere and create confusion for guests in either having to post higher rental rates to include the taxes, or a surprise after renting that taxes are due by the guest.

To compare actual prices requires a lot of navigating back and forward.  \\nTwo, personal filter preferences are not saved which makes a new search a bit more difficult, or worse, I have to go back and forth because something or other is not clear or I’m trying to compare different places and the filters default back to showing a different set of options which can bring up, for example, studio apts instead of the 2br apts I had previously been looking for.

Now I’m out another $2,000 just from booking through this awful site. I can honestly not warn people enough, I will be posting more for those who are interested. But just as a warning I’ve called 3 times now and been on hold for over 2 hours total with not one human being responding. I pray that no one else has to experience this when it’s supposed to be a “consumer friendly” way to travel. I can’t express enough how bad they have been through this COVID process.

Editing a review once you have entered it can only be done within 48 hours and it must be done from a desktop computer. So be thoughtful and careful with every detail when entering a review for your host and for your accommodation.  We have had 100 percent positive experiences with all of our stays with Airbnb. This will be our third trip using Airbnb.'},\n",

We were unable to have a guest add a third person to one booking, we had a guest request to stay an extra night but was unable to change the booking through the app. There are some major bugs that need to be fixed for the app to get 5 stars but overall it gets the job done.'},\n",

I will never stay at an Airbnb alone and with a host again. And beware Airbnb doesn’t care about victims. FYI you can’t get a police report immediately after an incident and even so you just got a number for the report not the full report. They were obviously just trying to revictimize me with this ridiculous request.',\n",

I'll take a guess that there is a limit of lists on the app, which I must say is bs and I would recommend you guys allow people to make as many lists as they want. I have also noticed that the search engine doesn't provide a list of related areas anymore, if you are to type in a city or place. This causes issue because now you have to weirdly specify what exact area you are talking about. These are the only two main problems I see with the app, I would like to see these problems fixed.\",\n",

All I can say is I am so grateful for Airbnb and their amazing customer service support team for making my birthday trip possible once more. You all (and especially Jade!!) were incredible and I can’t say enough good things. If you’re worried about the risk of an Airbnb cancelling on you-know Airbnb will go above and beyond to make things right. Thank you all!!!',\n",

They have been weak and have caved to an extremely anti- Semitic and horrifically biased anti-semitic movement, and by anti semitic, I mean Anti Jewish. Disgusting!\\n\\n If Airbnb decides to be reasonable and change their mind about this, I will take down this review. If it is still up, it means that they haven’t. \\n\\nAirbnb, you messed with the wrong crew. And if you want to be on the right side of history, you better change your policy soon, before you go completely out of business.',\n",

It’s extremely unfair and misleading when trying to find a perfect house for a stay. That’s what reviews are for. So this review is to let those know who don’t know, that some reviews have removed anything that might hurt the houses chance of getting someone to stay.

I booked the rest of my trip at a Hilton. At least I know what to expect. \\n——\\nAdmittedly, I haven’t used this app often. The city searches can be SO off as to be useless. Recently however, the terms are changing and NOT in favor of the customer. As someone already noted, having to submit one’s drivers license to book via the app.  I did not feel comfortable with that. \\n\\nI had to pay for an entire stay in full (months down the road) on the day I booked. There was no way to quickly change a typo on the date. I had to book it and THEN change the date. Once that was done, I was [supposedly] credited back for one day. I am still waiting for the credit on my card. Makes no sense that one can be charged in seconds yet a credit takes how long? As I said, still waiting. \\n\\nThe icing on the cake was an email that I received today informing me that emails regarding work trips would now go to my work email. An email for a place I have never even worked!!!!!! I am livid. That’s the last straw concerning privacy issues; especially incorrect information 🔥. \\nAfter my trip is completed in June, good bye Airbnb. 😡',\n",

I called Airbnb assuming it must be a mistake. They told me that it was technically allowed, but they would call the host and get her to lower the cost. They never did call her or call me back. It was too late to cancel my reservation, so we had to stay here in an uncomfortable position, and literally paying more than an extra night in cash on order to get a key. One of the things I love about Airbnb is that you know that the cost is up front, and there’s no additional fees added on at the end. I guess I was wrong!',\n",
